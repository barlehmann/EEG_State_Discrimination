# Getting average amplitude (in uV) data from a specific sensor into a file and printing it:
def extract_mean_amplitude_to_data(Picks, excel_file= 'Mood_Focus_Table.xlsx'):
    '''
    This extract_mean_amplitude_to_data function's  purpose is to read an EEG file (using the read_raw_eeg_file such as:
    'AusEC.edf' is used and to extract from it overall amplitude data for (a) specific electrode(s) of interest (in this
    case Pz is the 10-20 electrode location of interest) and to insert this information along with the timestamp of the
    recording as a new row in the excel datafile 'Mood_Focus_Table' tabulating biometric data alongside subjective report
    of mood and focus likert-scale ratings.
    The extract_mean_amplitude_to_data takes the argument Picks which specifies the specific electrode(s) being looked at
    An example of using this function might look like:
    read_raw_eeg_file('AusEC.edf')
    extract_mean_amplitude_to_data(Picks = 'EEG Fp2-LE')
    Of course, the read_raw_eeg_file must specify a particular file to be extracting the mean amplitude from, which is why
    this function is being used before the extraction function. Note that the amplitudes input into the excel sheet are sometimes rounded to the nearest whole number and sometimes not. This inconsistency will be addressed in a later version.
